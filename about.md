I'm a developer at PayPal, working mostly in Java and Apache Pig.

I'm also the maintainer of the [pig-eclipse project](https://github.com/eyala/pig-eclipse), and the creator/maintainer of [gedit-pig](https://github.com/eyala/gedit-pig), a pig syntax highlighting scheme for gedit.

Before PayPal I was a team leader and developer at Vidmind, working on their recommendation engine and DRM solutions.

And before that I worked at SAP on the Visual Composer and River projects.
